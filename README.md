# Redux-Ecomm

## Description

An E-Commerce full stack application built with React, GraphQL, and a MongoDB Database. This app has been refactored to use Redux to manage a global state to prevent prop drilling. The app also includes the stripe api for test functionality and checkout. This app was refactored from a previous project [HERE](https://github.com/Jaydon-Goodrich/shop-shop).
